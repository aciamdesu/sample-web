            <h7 class="biology"><b>About Persian</b></h7>
            <pre>Persian is a large, quadrupedal, feline Pokémon. Its fur is pale tan with the exception of its
black-rimmed ears. It has a short muzzle with a small, black nose, red eyes with slit pupils, 
rounded ears, a pair of pointed teeth in its upper jaw, and three whiskers on either side of 
its face. Its thick whiskers are very sensitive to changes in air movements, enabling it to 
detect its prey by movement alone. In the center of its forehead is a red jewel. Its long 
tail has a distinctive curl at the end. Persian communicates with body language and holds 
its tail upright to signal its intention to pounce. It has long legs and three-toed paws with 
retractable claws. Persian's lithe muscles also enable it to walk without making a sound.

Persian normally lives in towns and cities. Although popular for its elegance, it is extremely 
difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality. It will scratch 
anyone, including its Trainer, with little or no provocation, and has been observed ripping 
its prey apart for no discernible reason. However, when Persian is yanked by its whiskers, 
it becomes temporarily docile for unknown reasons. It is popular among rich people and is 
targeted by hunters for its jewel. Its relationship with Perrserker is one of mutual disdain, 
as Persian's refined and elegant personality clashes with Perrserker's barbaric nature. In 
the past, Pay Day was its signature move.
                
Alolan Persian has a body that is similar to its regular counterpart, but it has blue-gray fur. 
Its face has a different shape, being larger and more rounded with noticeable jowls. This 
distinctive face, along with its high-class softer-than-velvet fur coat, is admired by the 
people of Alola. Its eyes are usually in a half-closed state, and instead of a red forehead 
jewel, it has a blue jewel. The jewel, though different in appearance, is made of mostly the 
same material the one on a regular Persian. In behavior, it is described as highly intelligent 
and having an even higher opinion of itself. It prefers to use underhanded tactics in battle, 
but its haughty personality causes it to underestimate opponents.</pre></div>
